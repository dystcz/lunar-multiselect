Multiselect field that allows saving of multiple values at once. Multiselect options are filled the same way as the Dropdown field which is already in the core.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require dystcz/lunar-multiselect
```

## Usage

Just require this package and the multiselect field will appear in the Lunar admin hub. It registers itself automatically.

## TODO

- [x] Find out how to solve the @wireUiScripts problem (where to include the script)
- [ ] Make select configurable with all its options
- [x] Do not rely on WireUI for the multiselect component (can be used to skip first todo)
- [ ] Unit tests

### Testing

```bash
composer test
```
